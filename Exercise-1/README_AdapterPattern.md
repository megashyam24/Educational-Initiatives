The Adapter Pattern allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. I understood it as a translator that helps two systems communicate without changing their original code.

For my implementation, I used a memory card and USB example. MemoryCard classes (SDCard, MicroSDCard) have their own readData() methods, while USBPort defines the interface the program expects. CardAdapter bridges the gap, letting any MemoryCard connect to a USBPort.

The program asks which card to connect, creates the corresponding MemoryCard, and wraps it with CardAdapter. Calling connect() then allows the card to communicate seamlessly with the USBPort.

This project showed how structural patterns simplify integration and make object composition flexible without modifying existing code.
