The Factory Pattern helps create objects without knowing their exact classes in advance. I saw it as a way to separate object creation from usage, keeping the main program simple and flexible.

For my implementation, I used a music playlist example. The PlaylistFactory decides which playlist to create—Workout, Relax, Party, or Focus—based on the user’s mood. The Playlist interface defines common behavior (playSongs()), and each playlist implements it differently.

The program asks for the user’s mood and generates the corresponding playlist dynamically. This shows how the Factory pattern promotes loose coupling and makes adding new types easy.
