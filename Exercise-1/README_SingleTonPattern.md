The Singleton Pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point. I understood it as a way to control object creation so that all references point to the same object.

I implemented a PrinterManager class to manage print jobs. The static getInstance() method guarantees that only one object exists, even if multiple references are created.

This example fits well because printing tasks involve shared resources, making a single instance practical. The program asks for the number of documents and alternates printing between two references (pm1 and pm2).

Despite using two references, the print count remains consistent, demonstrating the Singleton pattern. This project helped me understand how to control object creation and manage shared resources effectively.
