The Strategy Pattern lets a program define multiple algorithms and swap them at runtime without changing the main logic. I understood it as a way to choose “how” a task is done dynamically, which is useful when multiple approaches exist.

For my implementation, I built a DocumentEditor that can modify text in different ways: uppercase, lowercase, or reversing it. The editor doesn’t handle the details—it just applies the chosen strategy.

The program takes user input and applies the selected strategy, showing the edited text instantly. This demonstrates how behavior can change at runtime while keeping the core logic clean.

I chose this example because it’s practical and interactive, letting me experiment with switching strategies easily.
